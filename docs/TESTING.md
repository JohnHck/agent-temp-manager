* Self-contained harness (no Pester).
* Every write happens inside a sandbox `%TEMP%\atm-tests-<random>` created and removed by the suite,
  **outside** any real agent temp directory. Junctions are unlinked before removal; `rd` never follows them.
* Tests touching the real machine are read-only (profile discovery, full inventory, CLI `verify`/`version`).
* Optional: set `ATM_PRIVATE_NEEDLES` to a file (kept outside the repository) listing private identifiers;
  the privacy test fails if any of them appears in the repository.

## Coverage

| Area | Cases |
|---|---|
| Empty collections | no profiles, missing base, empty base, empty process list |
| Paths | spaces, Unicode (Latin + CJK), case-insensitive references, forward slashes |
| Classification | RECENT, ORPHAN_SUSPECTED, clock skew, loose files, non-UUID dirs, invalid scopes, unrecognised base, shared TEMP |
| Partitions | sum of partitions = independent total; no duplicates; logical vs allocated |
| Permissions | unreadable subdirectory, unreadable base, no delete right, read-only file, other user (non-admin / admin), NTFS owner mismatch |
| Processes | uninspectable processes, snapshot failure, real process referencing a root, self-exclusion of the launcher chain |
| References | direct, ancestor-only (scope/base), ambiguous (8.3/wildcard) |
| Sessions | live sessions in two profiles, PID reuse, PID without start time, corrupt registry, recent transcript, unloaded profile |
| Reparse points | junction as root, junction inside root, junction in ancestor (TEMP), directory symlink (if permitted) |
| In use | open file (exclusive and fully shared), process working directory inside root |
| Allowlist | traversal, relative, UNC, `\\?\`, wildcards, ADS, trailing separator/dot, 8.3, whitespace, double separators, profile/TEMP/base/scope/drive roots, case mismatch, duplicates, outside allowlist |
| Clean flow | missing presenter/reader, absent/wrong confirmation, change between preview and clean, change after confirmation, root removed, successful deletion with siblings intact, post-audit |
| Read-only | audit + preview leave the sandbox byte-for-byte and timestamp identical |
| TUI | headless navigation of every screen, ASCII fallback, 60x20 terminal, cleanup through the engine |
| Layering | TUI/report contain no deletion APIs; audit engine neither prints nor deletes; single deletion call site |
| Providers | contract validation, test-only second provider through the same engine and gates |
| Installer | copy + manifest + verify, tamper detection, ACL audit, refusal without elevation, launcher exit codes |
| Security review regressions | rename/junction swap of subdirectory, scope and base during deletion is impossible (with a no-pin control), pre-existing redirection refused, third-party write ACL on base blocks, `%WINDIR%\Temp` shared, unexpected `procStart` never means "ended", drill-down/output path validation, no command-line fragments in evidence |
| Native assembly | installer-compiled DLL loads only with matching manifest hash (5.1 and 7); tampered DLL refused |
| I18n | catalog parity and identical placeholders; every used key translated; language resolution and safe fallback; en-US audit/preview/plan/TUI with no pt-BR text; identical engine codes across languages; CLI `-Lang`/`ATM_LANG`; ASCII transliteration |
| Clean environment | Windows Sandbox configuration generator (valid `.wsb`, networking disabled, release read-only); the in-sandbox script itself needs an administrator-enabled Windows Sandbox or VM (`NAO_TESTADO` on this machine) |
| Scale | 200,000 files in one root, bounded managed memory |
| Privacy | scanner self-test with planted data; working tree and Git index free of SIDs, e-mails, user paths, tokens, machine/user names and private identifiers; only `dist/` ignored |
| Portability | one user; several users (audited / inaccessible / hive not loaded / no Claude Code); profile on another drive letter (`subst`); no Claude Code; empty TEMP and empty root; unidentified projects and session-based identification with collision handling; Unicode, spaces, apostrophe, `&`, `#`, parentheses in profile and install paths; per-profile TEMP expansion (redirected, other drive, unresolvable variable) |

## Privilege matrix

Requirement PRIV-11 ([ELEVATION.md](ELEVATION.md)): behaviour that depends on privileges is verified with **real**
tokens, not only with the injected test identities the suite uses for gate logic. Expected results for V0.1:

| Scenario | Expected | Covered today |
|---|---|---|
| Standard user, not elevated | audit/preview/TUI work; other profiles inaccessible and other accounts' processes not observable are reported; coverage incomplete; clean blocked; installer scripts refuse | Suite and probe, locally (Windows 10, PS 5.1 and 7); installed product as a real standard user in CI (`install e2e`: Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows 11 ARM64), who also cannot write the install directory |
| Administrator, not elevated (filtered UAC token) | Same as a standard user (`elevated administrator: NO`) | Probe, Windows 10 x64, PS 5.1 (manual) |
| Administrator, elevated (consent prompt) | Full process coverage where Windows allows; other users' paths need `-IncludeOtherUsers`; installer works | Elevated session (no prompt: CI runners start elevated): suite and real install / update / rollback / uninstall in CI (`install e2e`). The consent prompt itself: probe after approving it, Windows 10 x64, PS 5.1 (manual) |
| Elevated with another account's credentials (standard user, or policy requiring credentials) | Process identity = that administrator account (its profile is "own"); the requester's profile is another user's and needs `-IncludeOtherUsers`; installer records the administrator | Not yet (manual; needs a second administrator account) |
| UAC prompt cancelled | No elevated session, nothing changed | Windows 10 x64 (manual): no elevated window opened |
| Non-interactive session (SSH, WinRM, scheduled task) | Runs with the caller's token; never waits for a prompt | Partial: `-NonInteractive` host from an existing session, Windows 10 x64, PS 5.1; SSH, WinRM and scheduled task not yet |
| Windows 11 | Same results as Windows 10 for every row above | Windows 11 ARM64 in CI (`install e2e`); Windows 11 x64: not yet (manual) |

Manual rows: [docs/release/PRIVILEGE-MATRIX-RUNBOOK.md](release/PRIVILEGE-MATRIX-RUNBOOK.md) and the read-only probe
`tools/privilege-matrix/Invoke-PrivilegeProbe.ps1`.

## Real installation (CI, disposable VMs)

`tests/e2e/Invoke-InstallE2E.ps1` (job `install e2e`) refuses to run outside a GitHub-hosted runner. A `build package`
job builds the release once; each `install e2e` job installs that same zip (SHA-256 checked) on Windows Server 2025,
Windows Server 2022 or Windows 11 ARM64, with the installer under PowerShell 5.1 or 7, and checks: installed release
gate, CLI from a new process with the machine PATH, clean of an old session root stops without deleting it, update,
rollback, tamper detection (exit 5) and repair, a real standard user (created only in the VM) running audit, preview
and verify without write access to the install directory, uninstall (directory and PATH entry removed). Evidence is
uploaded as artifacts.

Gate logic for administrators and other users is also exercised with injected identities (`IsAdmin`, profile SID
different from the process SID) in every run, on both shells. Manual rows are recorded in the release notes as
done or `NAO_TESTADO`, never assumed.

Results are `PASS`, `FAIL` or `NAO_TESTADO` (a prerequisite was unavailable, e.g. no free drive letter for
`subst` or no symlink privilege); `NAO_TESTADO` is never counted as a pass.
